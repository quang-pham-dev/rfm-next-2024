# Config Directory

The `config` directory is dedicated to managing configurations for the project. It contains various settings, environment variables, and setup files that configure the behavior of the application.

## Purpose

Configuration management is essential for customizing the behavior of the application based on different environments (e.g., development, staging, production) or specific requirements. This directory serves as a centralized location for storing configuration files, making it easier to manage and maintain project settings.

## Contents(example)

- app-config.ts: Main application configuration file containing general settings such as API endpoints, authentication keys, and other global variables.
- theme-config.ts: Configuration file for theming and styling options, including color palettes, font styles, and layout settings.
- environment-config.ts: Environment-specific configuration file for managing settings related to different deployment environments (e.g., development, staging, production).

Each configuration file contains specific settings and options relevant to its purpose, allowing for easy customization and adaptation to different scenarios or requirements.

Feel free to explore each configuration file for more details on the available settings and their usage.
