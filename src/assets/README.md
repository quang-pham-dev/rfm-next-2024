# Assets Directory

The `assets` directory is dedicated to managing image, font, and media assets for the project. It contains subdirectories and files that store various types of assets used in the application, such as images, icons, fonts, and multimedia files.

## Purpose

Assets play a crucial role in enhancing the visual appeal and user experience of the application. By organizing assets in this directory, developers can easily reference and import them into components, stylesheets, and other parts of the application, facilitating consistent design and efficient asset management.

## Contents

- images: Directory containing image assets used in the application, such as logos, illustrations, background images, and product photos.
- icons: Directory containing icon assets in various formats (e.g., SVG, PNG) used for UI elements, buttons, navigation items, and other graphical elements.
- fonts: Directory containing font assets (e.g., TTF, OTF) used for typography and text rendering in the application, including custom fonts and font families.
- videos: Directory containing video assets used for multimedia content, such as promotional videos, tutorials, and embedded media.
- audio: Directory containing audio assets used for sound effects, background music, and audio notifications in the application.
  Each subdirectory within the assets directory organizes assets according to their type or purpose, making it easier to locate and manage specific types of assets.

Feel free to explore each subdirectory for more details on the assets stored within them.
