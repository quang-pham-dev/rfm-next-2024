# Components Directory

The `components` directory is dedicated to managing common components for the project. It contains reusable UI components, such as buttons, forms, cards, and headers, that can be shared across multiple screens or modules within the application.

## Purpose

Creating a centralized location for common components helps promote code reusability, maintainability, and consistency in the user interface. By encapsulating UI logic and presentation details within reusable components, developers can streamline development, reduce duplication, and ensure a consistent user experience throughout the application.

## Contents(example)

- Button: Common button component with customizable styles and onPress handlers.
- TextInput: Reusable text input component for capturing user input with support for validation and error handling.
- Card: Component representing a card layout for displaying content, such as images, text, and actions.
- Header: Header component for displaying navigation titles, back buttons, and other header elements.
- Modal: Reusable modal component for displaying pop-up windows, dialogs, or modals with custom content and actions.
- List: Component for rendering lists of items with support for pagination, scrolling, and item rendering customization.

Each component within the components directory encapsulates specific UI functionality and can be easily imported and used in various parts of the application.

Feel free to explore each component file for more details on its implementation and usage.
