# Lib Directory

The `lib` directory contains external libraries, modules, or reusable components used in this project. It's a central place for organizing and managing dependencies that are not part of the main source code. This directory helps maintain a clean project structure by separating external code from the project's core logic.

## Contents

- [API provider](./api-provider.tsx): Description of library A and its purpose.
- [Root provider](./root-provider.tsx): Brief explanation of module B and its functionality.

Feel free to explore each subdirectory for more details on individual components.
