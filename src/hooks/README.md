# Hooks Directory

The `hooks` directory is dedicated to managing custom hooks for the project. It contains files that define custom React hooks, which encapsulate reusable logic and functionality that can be shared across multiple components in the application.

## Purpose

Custom hooks allow developers to extract and reuse stateful logic from components, making it easier to maintain and test the codebase. By organizing custom hooks in a centralized location, developers can promote code reusability, reduce duplication, and improve the overall modularity of the application.

## Contents(example)

- useLocalStorage.js: Custom hook for managing stateful data in local storage, providing functions to read, write, and delete data stored in the browser's localStorage API.
- useFetch.js: Custom hook for handling data fetching and asynchronous operations, encapsulating logic for making HTTP requests, managing loading and error states, and handling response data.
- useForm.js: Custom hook for managing form state and validation, providing functions to track form inputs, handle changes, validate input values, and submit form data.
- useTheme.js: Custom hook for accessing theme settings and styles from the theme context, allowing components to dynamically adjust their appearance based on the current theme.
- useAuth.js: Custom hook for accessing authentication state and functionality from the auth context, providing functions to authenticate users, check login status, and manage user sessions.
  Each custom hook within the hooks directory encapsulates specific logic and functionality that can be reused across different components in the application.

Feel free to explore each custom hook file for more details on its implementation and usage.
