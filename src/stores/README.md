# Stores Directory

The `stores` directory contains stores, which are state management modules using the Zustand library. These stores help manage the application's state in a reactive and efficient way, providing a central location for shared data across components. Organizing stores in this directory enhances code modularity and ensures a clean separation of concerns related to state management.

## Contents
