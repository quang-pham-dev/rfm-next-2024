# Interfaces Directory

The `interfaces` directory is dedicated to managing TypeScript interface and type definitions for the project. It contains files that define interfaces, types, and custom data structures used throughout the application.

## Purpose

Using TypeScript interfaces and types helps enforce type safety, improve code readability, and provide better IDE support for developers. By centralizing interface definitions in this directory, developers can easily reference and reuse common data structures across different parts of the application.

## Contents(example)

- User.ts: Interface definition for representing user data, including properties such as username, email, avatar, and authentication tokens.
- Post.ts: Interface definition for representing post data, including properties such as title, content, author, and creation date.
- Comment.ts: Interface definition for representing comment data, including properties such as text, author, post ID, and creation date.
- Theme.ts: Interface definition for representing theme settings and styles, including properties such as color palette, font styles, and layout options.
- Localization.ts: Interface definition for representing localization data, including properties such as language code, translations, and language-specific settings.
  Each interface file within the interfaces directory defines a specific data structure or data type used within the application, providing clear and concise definitions for TypeScript type checking and documentation purposes.

Feel free to explore each interface file for more details on its properties and usage.
