# Constants Directory

The `constants` directory is dedicated to managing constant values and definitions for the project. It contains files that define various constants, enums, or static values used throughout the application.

## Purpose

Constants play a crucial role in maintaining consistency, readability, and maintainability of the codebase. By centralizing constant definitions in this directory, it becomes easier to manage and update values across the entire project.

## Contents(example)

- error-codes.ts: File defining error codes and messages used for error handling and reporting.
- constants.ts: File containing miscellaneous constant values such as timeouts, limits, and default configurations.
- navigation.ts: File defining navigation routes and screen names used for routing within the application.
- enums.ts: File defining enumerations and constant values for specific data types or states.
- styles.ts: File defining global styles, themes, and CSS classes used for styling components.

Each file within the constants directory serves a specific purpose and organizes related constant values in a structured manner.

Feel free to explore each file for more details on the defined constants and their usage.
